I am a Ph.D graduate from [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.washington.edu/) at University of Washington (UW). During my Ph.D at UW, I was fortunated to be advised by Prof [Vladimir Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/). My research focuses on stochastic modeling, Bayesian inference and MCMC algorithm on time series data. I'm working on fitting stochastic epidemic model to mutliple data types such as genetic data and surveillance data. 

I was born and grew up in Beijing, China, where I . At the age of 18, I went to Nanjing University to study mathematics. In the Fall of 2012, I was an exchange student in the department of Mathematics and Statistics at Unversity of Melbourne, Austrilia. 

In my spare time, I enjoy all kinds of outdoor activities like hiking, skiing and gym workout. I'm a big fan of sports games. I like playing soccer and watching soccer games.

Research Interests:
======
1. Stochastic Modeling, Bayesian Analysis, MCMC algorithm, Infectious disease modeling
1. Machine (deep) learning, Convex optimization
