I am an infrastrature data scientist at Facebook. My work focuses on leveraging statistics and machine learning to optimize strategies on infratructure level. Currently I'm working closely with the AI infra team on projects related to scalability, reliability and efficiency. 

I obtained my from Ph.D degree from [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.washington.edu/) at University of Washington (UW). During my Ph.D at UW, I was fortunated to be advised by Prof [Vladimir Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/). My research focuses on stochastic modeling, Bayesian inference and MCMC algorithm on time series data. I'm working on fitting stochastic epidemic model to mutliple data types such as genetic data and surveillance data. 

I was born and grew up in Beijing, China, where I spent wonderful 18 years. After the nation college entrance exam, I went to Nanjing University (NJU) to study mathematics and obtained my bechelor degree in 2013. In the Fall of 2012, I was an exchange student in the department of Mathematics and Statistics at Unversity of Melbourne, Austrilia. 

In my spare time, I enjoy all kinds of outdoor activities like hiking, skiing and gym workout. I'm a big fan of sports games. I like playing soccer and watching soccer games.

This website is currently under construction. I'm going to keeping adding new stuffs. 

Research Interests:
