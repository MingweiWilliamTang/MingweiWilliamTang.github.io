About me

I am a recent Ph.D graduate from [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.washington.edu/) at University of Washington (UW). During my Ph.D at UW, I was fortunated to be advised by Prof [Vladimir Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/). I'm interested in stochastic modeling, Bayesian inference and MCMC algorithm. I'm currently working on fitting stochastic epidemic model to mutliple data types such as genetic data and surveillance data. 

I was born and grew up in Beijing, the capital of China. At the age of 18, I went to Nanjing University to study mathematics. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, skiing and gym workout. 

Research Interests:
======
1. Stochastic Modeling, Bayesian Analysis, MCMC algorithm, Infectious disease modeling
1. Machine (deep) learning, Convex optimization
